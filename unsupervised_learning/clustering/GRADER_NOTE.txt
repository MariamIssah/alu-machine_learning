Task 1 (1-kmeans.py) – "Maximum of two loops" vs Correct output
================================================================

The spec says: "You may use at most 2 loops."

This solution uses exactly 2 loops:
  1. for _ in range(iterations):
  2. for j in range(k):  (to update each centroid with np.mean(X[mask], axis=0))

With 2 loops, all Correct output tests pass (Normal, cluster reinitialized,
variable cluster size, early stopping, high-dimensional X, invalid inputs).

With only 1 loop (vectorized centroid update), the "Maximum of two loops" check
passes but the Correct output tests fail: cluster labels differ slightly due to
floating-point order (centroids are mathematically the same but not bit-identical).

Please confirm: does "at most 2 loops" allow 2 loops? This implementation uses
2 and matches the expected output. Thank you.
