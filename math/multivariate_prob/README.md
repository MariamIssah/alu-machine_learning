### **Multivariate Probability**

This project focuses on key concepts of multivariate statistics using Python and NumPy. It involves computing the **mean vector**, **covariance matrix**, and **correlation matrix** of multivariate data, as well as implementing the **Multivariate Normal (Gaussian) Distribution** and calculating the **Probability Density Function (PDF)** at a given point.

#### Key Tasks:

1. **Mean and Covariance**:
   Compute the mean and covariance matrix from a 2D dataset without using `numpy.cov`.

2. **Correlation Matrix**:
   Derive the correlation matrix from a given covariance matrix.

3. **Multivariate Normal Class**:
   Build a `MultiNormal` class to store the mean and covariance from a dataset (shape: d Ã— n).

4. **PDF Method**:
   Implement a `pdf(x)` method to evaluate the probability density of a multivariate normal distribution at point `x`.

#### Learning Outcomes:

- Understand joint and multivariate distributions
- Compute and interpret covariance and correlation
- Understand and work with multivariate Gaussian distributions
- Apply matrix operations like inverse and determinant in statistical modeling

All code adheres to strict formatting rules (PEP8), avoids restricted functions (like `numpy.cov`), and demonstrates core machine learning math foundations.
