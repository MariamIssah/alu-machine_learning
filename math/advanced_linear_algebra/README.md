# Advanced Linear Algebra

This repository contains implementations of several advanced linear algebra operations in Python. The goal is to build a solid foundation in linear algebra concepts while practicing algorithmic problem solving using NumPy.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `0-determinant.py`: Computes the determinant of a square matrix.
- `1-minor.py`: Computes the minor of a matrix element.
- `2-cofactor.py`: Calculates the cofactor matrix.
- `3-adjugate.py`: Returns the adjugate (adjoint) of a matrix.
- `4-inverse.py`: Computes the inverse of a matrix, if it exists.
- `5-definiteness.py`: Determines whether a matrix is positive definite, semi-definite, or indefinite.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Matrix determinants
- Minors and cofactors
- Adjugate matrices
- Inverse of a matrix
- Matrix definiteness (using eigenvalues)
- Input validation and error handling
- NumPy for numerical computation

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

You can install NumPy with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
