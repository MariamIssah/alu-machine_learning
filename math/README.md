ðŸ”¢ Linear Algebra Tasks
A collection of Python scripts for the ALU Machine Learning curriculum, covering basic to advanced linear algebra operations such as slicing, trimming, adding, and concatenating matrices.

Key Files and Functions:

0-slice_me_up.py: Slice a 2D matrix.

1-trim_me_down.py: Trim matrix to specific dimensions.

2-size_me_please.py: Get matrix shape.

3-flip_me_over.py: Transpose a matrix.

4-line_up.py: Add two 1D arrays.

5-across_the_planes.py: Add two 2D matrices.

6-howdy_partner.py: Concatenate 1D arrays.

7-gettin_cozy.py: Concatenate 2D matrices along an axis.

Advanced Tasks:

100-slice_like_a_ninja.py: Slice NumPy arrays.

101-the_whole_barn.py: Recursively add matrices.

102-squashed_like_sardines.py: Recursively concatenate matrices.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

NumPy (for advanced slicing)

Usage:
Run scripts with ./<file>.py and ensure execution permissions with chmod +x *.py.
