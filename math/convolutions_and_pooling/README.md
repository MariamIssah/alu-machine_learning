Convolutions and Pooling
This project teaches how images are processed using convolutions and pooling â€” two key building blocks of computer vision and deep learning.

What I Did
Built Python functions (using only NumPy) to:

Apply filters (kernels) to grayscale and color images

Add padding (to keep image size the same)

Use strides to move filters across the image

Combine multiple filters for more complex features

Why It Matters
Understanding how convolutions and pooling work:

Helps you build your own image classifiers

Forms the foundation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which power:

Face recognition

Medical image analysis

Self-driving car vision systems

Object detection in videos and more

This project bridges the gap between math and real-world AI applications. It's a crucial step toward building smarter, vision-based AI tools.
