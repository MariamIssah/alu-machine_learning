### **Bayesian Probability**

This project introduces **Bayesian reasoning** and applies **Bayes’ Theorem** to compute probabilities based on observed data and prior beliefs. It focuses on analyzing a medical case where patients may develop severe side effects after taking a new drug.

#### Key Concepts Implemented:

- **Likelihood**: Probability of observing data given a hypothesis.
- **Intersection**: Joint probability of data and a hypothesis.
- **Marginal Probability**: Overall probability of observing the data across all hypotheses.
- **Posterior**: Updated probability of a hypothesis after observing data.

#### Tasks:

1. `0-likelihood.py`: Calculates the likelihood of observing `x` patients with side effects out of `n`, for different probabilities `P`.
2. `1-intersection.py`: Multiplies likelihoods with priors to compute joint probabilities.
3. `2-marginal.py`: Sums all intersections to get the marginal probability.
4. `3-posterior.py`: Uses Bayes’ rule to compute the posterior probability for each `P`.

#### Outcome:

The project builds a solid foundation in **Bayesian statistics**, emphasizing how prior knowledge is updated with evidence to make informed probabilistic decisions.
